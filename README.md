 Rabbits are hunted by evil wolves and the only escape is to get them into the lair. There are N bunnies and N bees, and you have the distances from each bunny to each lair. You need to help them and calculate which rabbit will go in that lair so that the sum of the distances traveled by each of them is minimal.
